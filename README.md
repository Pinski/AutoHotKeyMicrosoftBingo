# AutoHotKey Microsoft Bingo Scripts
Inspired by KinectKid333's script he posted at TrueAchievements (http://www.trueachievements.com/forum/viewthread.aspx?tid=732469) I went a step further and enhanced the script.

Features:
- CTRL+B starts the autodaubt
- Checks if a tile is already daubted and skips it

I tested the script using Windows 8.1 on Hyper-V at a resolution of 1920x1080.
